    "# Lab: Random Variable 💯\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and data science, random variables are used to model events that have uncertain outcomes.  For example, in DISCOVERY, we explore the **binomial distribution** to model flipping a coin, drawing from a deck of cards, guessing on a multiple choice exam, and many other events with a single, fixed probability of success.  However, what if there are multiple different outcomes?  This lab will explore creating custom discrete distributions in Python to model complex events!\n",

    "To use this data to create a distribution, we need both the **outcome** and the **probability**.  Currently, we have the outcomes (`outcomes`), but we do not have a probability.  To convert `occurrences` to a probability, we need to divide `occurrences` by the total number of students to convert it to a probability.\n",
